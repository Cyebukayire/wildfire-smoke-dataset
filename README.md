# Open Wildfire Smoke Datasets

The goal is to curate wildfire smoke datasets to enable open sharing and ease of access of datasets for developing vision based wildfire detection models. Easy access and open sharing of datasets will facilitate and accelerate the research efforts in solving wildfire crisis.

#### HPWREN Cameras

[AI For Mankind](https://aiformankind.org/) downloaded the public domain HPWREN Cameras images and annotated these images with bounding boxes for object detection.

1. [Bounding Box Annotated Wildfire Smoke Dataset (Pascal VOC annotation format) Version 1.0](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sEB77bfp2yMkgsSW9703vwDHol_cK6D5/view?usp=sharing) for smoke detection. Thank you our founder [Wei Shung Chung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wei-shung-chung-01326a7/) in creating this first set of bounding boxes. In total, 744 bounding box annotated images are created.

Please provide attribution to HPWREN and AI For Mankind when using these bounding box annotated datasets.

For classification, you can checkout this dataset [Wildfire Smoke vs No Smoke datasets](https://tinyurl.com/roo8tas). We separated the images into smoke and no smoke categories for anyone who is interested in building a smoke classifier.

Stay tuned for the upcoming version 2 of bounding box annotated smoke dataset created with the help of AI For Mankind's volunteers in collaboration with [HPWREN](http://hpwren.ucsd.edu/). We will release the dataset after the [Lets Stop Wildfires Hackathon 2.0](https://aiformankind.org/lets-stop-wildfires-hackathon-2.0/)

We created a few promising wildfire smoke detection models using the version 1.0 of bounding box annotated wildfire smoke images (744 images). Learn more about our [wildfire smoke detection research](https://aiformankind.org/wildfire-smoke-detection-research/).

#### Detection Results
Our AI For Mankind's wildfire smoke detector aka "The Super Duper" built using this annotated dataset shows very promising results.
