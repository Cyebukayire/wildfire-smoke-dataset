# Open Wildfire Smoke Datasets

The goal is to curate wildfire smoke datasets to enable open sharing and ease of access of datasets for developing vision based wildfire detection models. Easy access and open sharing of datasets will facilitate and accelerate the research efforts in solving wildfire crisis.

#### HPWREN Cameras

AI For Mankind downloaded the public domain HPWREN Cameras images and labeled these images for bounding box object detection.
1. [HPWREN Cameras: Smoke/No Smoke datasets](https://tinyurl.com/roo8tas) We separated the images into smoke and no smoke categories for anyone who is interested in building a smoke classifier.
2. [HPWREN Cameras: Bounding Box Annotated Smoke Dataset (Pascal VOC annotation format)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sEB77bfp2yMkgsSW9703vwDHol_cK6D5/view?usp=sharing) We annotated these images using bounding box for smoke detection.

#### Become Volunteer 
AI For Mankind's volunteers will continue to annotate these HPWREN images and make them available here. Please feel free to reach out to us ai.for.mankind@gmail.com if you would like to volunteer your time to help with labeling.
